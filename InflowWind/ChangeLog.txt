InflowWind Change Log
===============================================================================
Initial release with AeroDyn v13.00.00a-bjj

Updates:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.00.01a-bjj
 -  I added the version number to this set of subroutines.
 -  I fixed a bug (first reported by C. Hansen) where the subroutines did not
      allow HH files with only 1 line of data.
 -  I fixed a potential problem that would cause the program to crash ungracefully
      if the first byte of the FF file is invalid. Now it will print an error
      message and return to the calling routine.
 -  I added a parameter for undefined WindType instead of just using 0 all the
      time. I wanted people to see that 0 is not allowed for new wind types
      when they look at SharedTypes.f90.
 -  I added the ability to read wind files generated in HAWC format.
 -  I replaced the logic used to determine if the file names in the CTP input
      file were relative with the new FUNCTION PathIsRelative() from the
      NWTC Library v1.04.00a-bjj.
 -  I fixed some logic in GetWindType() that incorrectly identified the file
      extension for files entered with no extension but with "." entered as
      the current directory (e.g. ".\wind\test" or "..\wind\AnotherTest")

 v1.00.01b-bjj 14-Nov-2011
 -  In HAWCWind.f90, I modified HW_Init(): The error statement after reading
      from the binary files is more descriptive. The read statement was fixed
      so that the code could be compiled in double precision while still reading
      binary data stored in single precision .

v1.01.00a-bjj, 01-Aug-2012
 -  I updated FFWind.f90 to read TurbSim periodic wind files. ".bts" files contain
      information to determine if the file contains a full period; ".sum" files
      corresponding to ".wnd" binary files contain text to relay this information.
      If the file is periodic, the first grid in the file is located at X=0 m;
      otherwise it is located at X=GridWidth/2 m (like it worked before). Periodic
      files will not have interpolation errors because the wind file is too short.

v1.01.00b-bjj, 10-Aug-2012, B. Jonkman
  - I fixed an error in the interpolation of tower files in the new
      periodic scheme when the time fell exactly between the two periods.

v1.02.00a-mlb, 02-Apr-2013, M. Buhl
  - I added SX(3) to scale the turbulence level in the three directions
      for HAWCWind.
  - I added a test to ensure that WindProfileType is either "LOG" or "PL".
  - I moved the conversion of WindProfileType to uppercase to just before the test.
  - I changed the test to ensure that Z0 > 0 so it does the test only if
      WindProfileType is "LOG".
  - I changed the version to v1.02.00a-mlb, 02-Apr-2013.

v1.02.00b-adp, 08-Apr-2013, A. Platt
  - Added a check after the MODULO statement on line 1800 of FFWIND.f90 to catch a
      rounding error within the modulo statement that could lead to accessing elements
      outside the FFData array.

v1.02.00c-bjj, 23-Apr-2013, B. Jonkman
  - Added a check after the MODULO statement on line 573 of HAWCWIND.f90 to catch a
    rounding error within the modulo statement (see log from v1.02.00b-adp).


 To Do:
 - Replace all global data with data types and make calling program store it
 - Create new input file for the module
 - remove all *_ADHack_* subroutines
 - Pick a name (WindInflow or InflowWind or ??) and make module name/routines consistant
 - Split FF wind type into different categories (BLADED, TurbSim, TurbSim's BLADED)
 - add ability to superimpose wind types
 - add user-defined wind profile?
 - add steady wind case (no turbulence, just add the wind profile from HAWC?)
 - add CTWind capability to test program (?)
